# odin-recipes This is my first project since I started this program, I am very happy about and I cannot wait to do many more projects.
This project is mainly about the recipes of my favourite Nigerian dishes. I chose Nigerian dishes because I am Nigerian and I cannot wait to educate the general public about the various types of dishes in my country.
